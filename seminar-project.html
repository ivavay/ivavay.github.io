						<span class="reveal">The Objective</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					Cultivate a culture of expressing deliberate gratefulness among undergraduate students or general audience members. 
					<p>
					1.) Provide a way for speakers to answer unresolved questions asked during their visit (class + lunch) <br>
					2.) Provide a way for students to access clips mentioned during talks or any additional resources that speakers may want to pass down
					<p>
					It's so easy to say a quick, authentic thank you, yet not many people do it because they underestimate its value.

						<span class="reveal">High Level Needs</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						These were the 3 high-level needs and proposed solutions that I had defined to address pain points after synthesizing students' responses from last year's class.
						<p>
						Need — Frustration may arouse from not being able to get to all the questions asked due to the class time constraint . Speakers may feel indebted to get to the rest of the questions. 
						<br>
						Solution — Provide a way for each speaker to quickly respond to questions that students have stated in their thank-you notes 
						<p>
						Need — Speakers may have more information they want to say to the students or resources to pass down. 
						<br>
						Solution — Enable channel for speakers to communicate lasting remarks on the overall experience of the visit as a way to respond to the thank-you notes, as well as the ability to drop a doc of aggregated resources for students because a lot of times, prepared clips were cut short or skipped over completely due to the constraint of time. 
						<p>
						Need — Students’ desire (along with the organizer/moderator) to let speakers know that they are appreciated for their time and insights. 
						<br>
						Solution — Assist students in writing genuinely written thank you notes
