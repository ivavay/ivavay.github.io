					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					Initially, this tiny side-hustle lab project was just going to be a website that displays thank you notes from students who want to express their appreciation for speakers that David invites to in his <a href="https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/#/courses/tim80l">Entrepreneurship and Leadership class</a>. The way he did it last winter was that he'd collect thank you notes and feedback responses from students through Google Form, bootstrap those content (?), and then email each of the guest speakers soon after with a unique link. Aside from the digital token of gratitude, I also designed a visual brand for a printed card and mug. A lot of the speakers were happy to receive this simple 'cherry-on-top' gesture, and so we thought that it would be fun to explore more of what this project could expand into.

					Primary - Cultivate a culture of expressing deliberate gratefulness among undergraduate students — or general audience members <br><br>
					Secondary <br>
					— Provide a way for speakers to answer unresolved questions asked during their visit (class + lunch) <br>
					— Provide a way for students to access clips mentioned during talks or any additional resources that speakers may want to pass down<br>
					<br>
					It's so easy to say a quick, authentic thank you, yet not many people do it because they <a href = "https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5394dfa6e4b0d7fc44700a04/t/5b9accf888251bd162f4d30f/1536871672114/Kumar+Epley+%282018%29+Undervaluing+gratitude+Psych+Science.pdf">underestimate its value</a>.

						<span class="reveal">Initial High-Level Needs</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					These were the 3 high-level needs and proposed solutions that I had defined to address pain points after synthesizing students' responses from last year's class.<br><br>

					Need — Frustration may arouse from not being able to get to all the questions asked due to the class time constraint . Speakers may feel indebted to get to the rest of the questions. <br>
					Solution — Provide a way for each speaker to quickly respond to questions that students have stated in their thank-you notes <br><br>

					Need — Speakers may have more information they want to say to the students or resources to pass down. <br>
					Solution — Enable channel for speakers to communicate lasting remarks on the overall experience of the visit as a way to respond to the thank-you notes, as well as the ability to drop a doc of aggregated resources for students because a lot of times, prepared clips were cut short or skipped over completely due to the constraint of time. <br><br>

					Need — Students’ desire (along with the organizer/moderator) to let speakers know that they are appreciated for their time and insights. <br>
					Solution — Assist students in writing genuinely written thank you notes

						<span class="reveal">Info Architecture — Speaker and Student Views</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					After defining these high-level needs, I jumped into diagramming the information architecture + hypothetical flow (I hadn't asked for critiques at this point yet so this was all my own guesswork) for the student and speaker view. In creating my info arch, I referenced to <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/a-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture-for-ux-designers/">this article</a> to help me avoid the use of repeating modules in visualizing the navigation of this first initial concept. I gave more attention to the 'student view' when I was crafting this because students were supposed to be our primary users on our platform

					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					I personally prefer jumping into Figma right away instead of the conventional method of sketching out low-fidelity boxes on paper because I tend to get very OCD with the proportions and aesthetics of inked lines. I can also get very distracted by my own inconsistent handwriting variations.

					In vectoring up these wireframes, I tried to apply the fine art technique of 'underpainting' by limiting myself to a grey-scale palette to convey flow and emphasis. I wanted to avoid jumping into colors, even if it's just a tint of some hex for a notification dot, and left the wireframes completely monochromatic.

					Patience, I murmur under my breath. Resist the temptation of colors. The thrill of exploring visual design can come later.

						<span class="reveal">A Check-in/ a pivot</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					11/16/2018 (Fri) - 2:45PM-3:45PM <br>

					Today, we made a pivot in our design direction. Instead of making a ‘thank you’ writing and submission site specifically for David’s future course use, we decided that it would be more interesting to go down the path of designing a platform that enables organizers to quickly create webpages for hosting speaker series — or on a broader spectrum, tackling the question of how we could better facilitate productive conversations around societal issues that people care about. I wasn't the one who thought of this idea. David did. I guess I just had always thought that people like designing and building event landing pages from scratch, because of the autonomy and freedom that comes with it. But, I guess time is a constraint in the real world.<br>
					The 1st iteration will be for university setting, specifically faculties in the BOSE who sometimes host seminar series or individual guest speaker talks.*

					We've decided to give the Seminar Platform a new name for branding purposes. We thought that "Lettuce" was cute because it's a pun of "Let Us"! I'm super grateful that David was supportive of this cute name because it did seem kind of unconventional to name a research project after a vegetable HAHA. Here, I played around with different variations of the logo. The final version that everyone liked was the one with the person cultivating vegetables sideways.

					- Only mock up the variations that you want the stakeholder to decide between <br>

					- Hold off discussions on visual design until much, much later so you’re not wasting your own or anyone’s time<br>

					- Need to make sure that I don’t waste time on fixing pixels or icon until the polishing stage<br>

					- How can I best illustrative the communication that happens between my professor and I throughout the project. Draw comic strips? An idea<br>
