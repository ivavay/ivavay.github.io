						to work on a project and 90 seconds to present to YC Partners towards the end of the event.

						<span class="reveal">Problem</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					
					1.) Imagine wanting to learn a particular topic just for fun! Where do you start? How do you start learning if you know absolutely nothing about a topic that you’re slightly interested in? There are a plethora of resources out there and everyone has different opinions on which ones you should read. You spend weeks, months, and sometimes even years, jumping between resources, only to waste more time in the end. 
					<br><br>
					You know there are people who’ve successfully gone through the process of learning something online, but they often don’t share their journeys because it is too time-consuming to write a comprehensive guide on how to get from point A to point B. 
					<br><br>
					Solution: <br>
					- An upvote system to filter lessons/resources for a particular topic <br>
					- An upvote system system to see the top recommended learning pathway(s) for a topic
					<br><br>
					2.) Learning can be isolating. You often have to sacrifice social time to learn something. There’s no social aspects to existing learning platforms. 
					<br><br>
						Solution: <br>
					-You can share what you’re currently learning to your feed for your friends and followers to see <br>
					-You can see which friends are currently learning a topic or have completed a learning pathway<br>
					-Learn in communities online/offline!*

					Uncertainties are assumptions we've made about our audience that are not backed up by user research due to the time constrainst of a hackathon. If we were given more time,

					<br><br>
					- People like to share what they’ve learned<br>

					Confer is a social learning platform designed to facilitate and guide you 
					through your learning journey. On the app, users can make posts to share their 
					learning progress with friends and teach others through pathways made of lessons. 
					As users go through lessons, a visual map of their knowledge domain is created for 
					them within their profile, which could then be useful for recruiters and friends to 
					check out.  As users go through pathways, they complete challenges that prompt them 
					to demonstrate their mastered concepts by posting on the feed. Users can also upvote
					a post or pathway as a way of filtering the most popular content in the community.

					It was a fun experience to push myself to design as fast as possible over the course of a day. 
					My teammate did the majority of the UX flow and information architecture planning so I was able to 
					focus on the visual design of the app a lot more. During the event, we also spent a good amount of time
					refining the product idea to distill it down to some main core features. Overall, I felt good about what
					I was able to accomplish with the amount of time given. I walked away with a tinkering desire to learn 
					how to build so I went home and bought a <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/learn/lecture/16762162?start=150">JS course</a> on Udemy right away.
