						<span class="reveal">Introduction</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
					In June of 2019, my friend and I stumbled our way into SF Design Week and crashed some of 
					their networking events. We’ve found that it was incredibly hard to find people to talk to 
					at these events because 1.) people are usually already chatting away in their formed circles 2.) 
					it was hard to find people who are working at the company who is hosting the event 3.) when we found
					those people, they might not even be interested in talking to us students because of reasons 
					still yet to be investigated 4.) music is usually too loud for a proper conversation to even occur.
					Having come all the way from hours away to attend these events, it was frustrating for us to not walk 
					away with the optimal experience. We were then curious and convinced that many also experience these
					problems in connecting with others at events, so we thought that it’d be fun to work on an event-based
					networking app to help people walk away from these events with continuable relationships.

						<span class="reveal">User Research</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
					After conducting user interviews on four people, I found some themes/patterns that were common across the people that I talked to, as well as some quotes that jumped out at me: <br>
					- Desire to learn about career pathways, such as how a person they admire got to where they are today<br>
					- Prefer mentor/mentee programs where they could get resources for design & general advice <br>
					- Advice given in the form of actionable things to work towards is incredibly helpful <br><br>
					
					<h3 class="reveal_content">
						<span class="reveal">Quotes</span>
					</h3>
						
					“Don’t do well in that type of situation - it’s just not for me - I feel like a lot of it is just small talk and not going really deep into things “<br>
					“Also should be a two way street!”<br>
					 “ I think that’s why Ed Chao’s advice stuck really well, because it had areas to get good at. Now though I need help to get better at visual design and prototyping and probably product thinking, so I’d look for mentorship in those areas. “<br><br>
					
					I then came up with this how-might-we statement to define the problem. This then became the compass in driving my initial paper sketches.<br>
