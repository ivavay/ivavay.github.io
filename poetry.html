					i’ve been spending much of my day <br>
					in mindless space <br>
					thinking about the alternatives <br>
					that i’m too afraid to chase <br><br>

					where would you see yourself in <br>
					twenty years<br>
					the assignment asks <br>
					in twenty years, i just want to be alive and well,<br>
					if it’s not too much to ask <br><br>

					i wrote my magazine column <br>
					down an untraditional path <br>
					the road less taken <br>
					where practicality ends <br>
					and little experiments begin <br><br>

					you see, i want to be an artist <br>
					of the written and visual world <br>
					i believe that art can indeed <br>
					stitch up the holes that no one sees<br>
					and wake up the soul that hasn’t spoke <br><br>

					ice on extinct<br>

					sunlit lawns<br>
					tightly rolled jeans, barefoot <br>
					faces dipped in fresh books <br>
					tranquility sets over campus <br>

					golden fields <br>
					dried-up hills <br>

					colors in full bloom <br>

					racing to get to the next stage <br>
					my mind too follows eagerly <br>
					in a kaleidoscopic wave <br><br>

					winter.<br>
					a prayer for peace <br>
					to settle this firing bricolage of <br>

					creativity to some as they call it <br>

					stands a tree of the knowledge of  <br>
					good and evil <br>
					to discern sure yes <br>

					fell trap  <br> <br>

					why did God create <br>
					that tree <br>
					was a question that’s always <br>
					baffled me <br> <br>

					from then on mankind toiled <br>
					their heavenly identity  <br>
					relinquished, stole <br>
					by the tree <br> 
					that for once  <br>
					severed the sea <br>
					the relationship tied  <br>
					between the creator and Eve  <br> <br>

					without the tree  <br>
					we’d still be in eden <br> <br> 

					no stories, ignorant bliss  <br>
					sheer perfection at ease  <br> <br>
