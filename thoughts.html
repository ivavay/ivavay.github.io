					i went to the bookstore in downtown today and stopped by the section where they laid out the books by the pressidential 
					candidates. i picked up andrew yang's war on normal peoople because the topic of the societal implications of automation 
					interests me. i'm currently 1/5 of my way into this book and i dig his writing style, which is very easy to digest. i'll 
					have to finish this book to see whether or not i agree with his stance on things, esp. on climate change and the ubi.

					lily and I tried out her new skateboard. we traversed down the road down our street to catch the sunset. 
					as we walked, we somehow got on the topic of religion. we exchanged our perspectives. she said it was eye opening
					to hear my uncoventional experience with christianity. i concluded that i'd rather label myself as a "follower of
					christ" than a christian, just because to say that you're a christian could mean many things, and it doesn't 
					necessarily mean that you are striving to perceive the world through Christ's lens.

					i've been thinking about the careers project ever since David and I talked about it on Thursday.
					what do people struggle with when they're just beginning to explore careers? i think most people find 
					out about the career they want to go into through hs or college clubs, or through people that they interact with.
					i'm aware this only pertains to people to live in resource-rich neighborhoods. what if you live in a small town in some 
					remote region of the us where you aren't exposed to potential jobs with promising career advancements. what if you come from a family 
					of migrant workers, or a family of bus drivers? how would you you ever get the support or the courage to try for a career
					that you had never even heard of, much less envision yourself in? i often think for the people that i have very little direct connections to. 
					i want to hear their stories.

					today i met up with a product designer @ Workday (thanks Marisa again if you're reading this!) in Berkeley with Jackie. 
					we spent two hours spearheading questions at her at Blue Bottle, sipping on our overpriced New Orleans and fruit-flavored
					fizz. we bonded over our overcasting imposter syndrome. 
					<br>
					before Berkeley, i was at philz ideating on the networking project
					with Ananya. she drove all the way from Tracy.
					she brought me a souvenior from Costa Rica.

					today i met up with Alonso at Abbott Square. we talked about what makes a photographer's work meaningful. 
					he was reading a book called Profit over People. then, he read me a snippet of a plot that he had just wrote on paper. 
					it was set in an apocalyptic world where love is devoid. it was captivating to listen to it. he asked me if i wanted to collab
					on a story with him. i said that i don't think i'm imaginative enough to come up with stuff like this.

					i have been on a hiatus of informing myself about the various inequalities 
					that plague this world because it is sometimes just too hard to even read about these stories. 
					but as a person wanting to go into design, i should garner up the courage to learn more about the people who 
					are struggling at the margins of society and try my best to understand the complexity of these issues.
					i want my designs to play a part in leveraging the voice of the unheard.
