						<span class="reveal">Initial Concept</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					Initially, this tiny side-hustle lab project was just going to be a website that displays thank you notes from students who want to express their appreciation for speakers that David invites to in his <a href="https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/#/courses/tim80l">Entrepreneurship and Leadership class</a>. The way he did it last winter was that he'd collect thank you notes and feedback responses from students through Google Form, bootstrap those content (?), and then email each of the guest speakers soon after with a unique link. Aside from the digital token of gratitude, I also designed a visual brand for a printed card and mug. A lot of the speakers were happy to receive this simple 'cherry-on-top' gesture, and so we thought that it would be fun to explore more of what this project could expand into.

					Primary - Cultivate a culture of expressing deliberate gratefulness among undergraduate students — or general audience members <br><br>
					Secondary <br>
					— Provide a way for speakers to answer unresolved questions asked during their visit (class + lunch) <br>
					— Provide a way for students to access clips mentioned during talks or any additional resources that speakers may want to pass down<br>

					It's so easy to say a quick, authentic thank you, yet not many people do it because they <a href = "https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5394dfa6e4b0d7fc44700a04/t/5b9accf888251bd162f4d30f/1536871672114/Kumar+Epley+%282018%29+Undervaluing+gratitude+Psych+Science.pdf">underestimate its value</a>.

						<span class="reveal">Initial High-Level Needs</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					These were the 3 high-level needs and proposed solutions that I had defined to address pain points after synthesizing students' responses from last year's class.<br><br>

					Need — Frustration may arouse from not being able to get to all the questions asked due to the class time constraint . Speakers may feel indebted to get to the rest of the questions. <br>
					Solution — Provide a way for each speaker to quickly respond to questions that students have stated in their thank-you notes <br><br>

					Need — Speakers may have more information they want to say to the students or resources to pass down. <br>
					Solution — Enable channel for speakers to communicate lasting remarks on the overall experience of the visit as a way to respond to the thank-you notes, as well as the ability to drop a doc of aggregated resources for students because a lot of times, prepared clips were cut short or skipped over completely due to the constraint of time. <br><br>

					Need — Students’ desire (along with the organizer/moderator) to let speakers know that they are appreciated for their time and insights. <br>
					Solution — Assist students in writing genuinely written thank you notes

						<span class="reveal">Info Architecture — Speaker and Student Views</span>
					</h3>
					<p class="reveal_content"><span class="reveal">
						
					After defining these high-level needs, I jumped into diagramming the information architecture + hypothetical flow (I hadn't asked for critiques at this point yet so this was all my own guesswork) for the student and speaker view. In creating my info arch, I referenced to this article to help me avoid the use of repeating modules in visualizing the navigation of this first initial concept. I gave more attention to the 'student view' when I was crafting this because students were supposed to be our primary users on our platform
