					We first started our process by taking a look at the current website. Then, we jotted down a general information architecture of what’s needed to be on there. Once we had the categories of what’s needed, we proceeded to sketching out the different pages on paper. Here are the screens’ flow that I drew. Papers and pens are a great way to explore different variations of the same screen in the beginning without getting too attached to fleshing out the details of the design.

					Once we’ve done that, we went on to create very low-fidelity mockups on Figma. We used a monochromatic grey-scale palette to make it easier to explore different layouts without getting distracted by colors. At this point, we still haven’t added any placeholder texts to the designs yet because we thought that it’d be better to first focus on figuring out the flow before content.

					For the next iteration, David (our professor) had wanted us to move on to the next fidelity by pulling actual texts from the existing website so that it’s easier for him to understand the context. I chose to make this batch of mid-fidelity mocks monochromatic blue because I thought it’d set help set the mood for later mocks without giving too much away.

					During the time Lily and I had worked together, we found it hard to collaborate together since both of our definitions of collaborating were widely different. 
					I was more accustomed to working on a design simultaneously with someone in Figma in real time, whereas she preferrred working individually then coming together to critique our respective designs. 
					In the end, without too much communication on either ends, we both came up with two variations of the final high-fidelity designs for the Tech4good lab website. 
					It wasn't an ideal situation, since the decision of whose gets picked came down to the stakeholder's personal preferences. It felt like a competition, which wasn't what I was hoping for. 
					Hers ended up getting picked, and I helped wrap up the project by finishing up the mobile version. 
					<p>
					I had learned that collaboration isn't intuitive unless the process is thought about and discussed beforehand. It's a team effort after all, not a competition. In the future, I know that I'd want more people involved
					in the ideation/brainstorming/sketching process so we could get everyone's perspectives on certain stylistic choices before delving into it too much on our own as designers.
					<p>	
					Below is a screenshot of the version that I had come up with, but didn't end up getting implemented.
